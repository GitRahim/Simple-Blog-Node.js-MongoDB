# Simple-Blog-Node.js-MongoDB
A simple blog I made with Node.js and MongoDB during watching udemy 100 days web dev bootcamp.
To see the project make sure you have node.js and MongoDB installed. In MongoDB create a database called "blog" and in it create a collection called "authors" and in it documents called "name" and "email" with any data you want. Then in terminal go to the project directory and write "npm install" command. After it finished downloading required packages, write "npm start".
